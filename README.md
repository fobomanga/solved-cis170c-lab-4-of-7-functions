Lab Overviewâ€”Scenario/Summary

You will code, build, and execute a program that simulates a coin toss and a dice roll.

Learning outcomes:

<ol>

 <li>Write functions using parameters.</li>

 <li>Be able to debug a program with syntax and logic errors.</li>

 <li>Be able to use the debug step-into feature to step through the logic of the program and to see how the variables change values.</li>

</ol>

<strong> </strong>Preparation:

If you are using the Citrix remote lab, follow the login instructions located in the lab area in Course Home.

Locate the Visual Studio icon, and launch the application.

   <td width="673">Write a program that simulates flipping a coin and rolling a dice. A user will input their choice of flipping a coin (C), rolling a dice (D), or exiting (E). If the user chooses a coin toss, the program will ask how many times the coin should be tossed, and then will simulate tossing the coin that many times and print the result to the user. If the user chooses rolling a die, the program will ask how many sides the die has and how many times it should be rolled.  The program will then simulate rolling a die (with the number of sides specified) that many times. The program will continue until the user presses E.  <strong>This should be a lot of fun!</strong><strong>Here are some great things to think about as you begin your program! </strong> You will need two functions. A string flipCoin() and a int rollDice(int) function<strong>. </strong>These functions will generate a random number. For the coin flip, the random number should be in the range of 1 to 2. If the number is 1, the function should return <em>heads.</em> If the random number is 2, the function should return <em>tails.</em> For the roll dice function, the random number should be in the range of 1 to the number of sides. The function should return the result of the die roll.Important notes: You will want to seed your random number generator. To do this at the beginning of your program #include &lt;ctime&gt;.Use the following commands to seed the random number generator.//Get the system time to use it to seed the random number generatorunsigned seed = time(0); //seed the random number generatorsrand(seed); To get a random number between 1 and 2, use the following code: int toss = 1 + rand() % 2;. <strong>Sample Output from the Program</strong> Welcome to the random value generator!Would you like to flip a coin (C), roll a die (D), or exit (E)?
